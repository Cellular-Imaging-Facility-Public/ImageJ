# Project
## Purpose

We have a mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) knockout mouse model only on positive NCC (sodium chloride co-transporter) cells.
To validate our knockout model, we did a series of co-immunofluorescence against NCC (membrane protein) and MR (localized at nuclear) on the kidneys of control and KO mice.
To answer the question if our KO is present or not, we would like to quantify the percentage of positive NCC cells that are MR positive.
